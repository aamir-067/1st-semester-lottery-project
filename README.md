Hello guys this is my 1st semester project teacher give this as a end semester project aka CEP.
i solved it in c which is the reqirements but at that time i am not that pro in coding thats whay in this code there is a little runtime problem.

**Working of the Code (expected)**
Its a lottery type project actually.

1. this will take the number of persons whose limit is >=6 and <=12 and take the monthly amount
2. if a person give less pr no money then it will be kicked from the lottery.
3. at last of every month it will accumulate the money and will select one person randomly and give all money to him and also he will be removed from the lottery
4. After last month it will show report wich will tell that which person is in profit or loss.

**What this code does**
this works good . but

1. it repeate the person selection means it select one person multiple times.
2. it not kick the person for lottery when he give less or no meny.
